#P5 Sketchbook

This is where I keep some experiments in p5

## To View
The start script kicks up browsersync to the sketch folder specified.

-npm install
-find the sketch you want to view in sketches/
-run `npm start {name-of-your-sketch}`

## To Add a Sketch
The new.js script creates a new sketch given the name provided. This
is based of an extremely skeletal empty-example sketch in the sketches folder.
You can modify the base template by changing the config.template value in 
package.json.
